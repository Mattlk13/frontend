# Tally
#### React/Relay/GraphQL 

This is the front end for Tally, a political awareness app focusing on the roles and responsibilities of our district representatives in the US Senate and Congress. 

Tally aims to bring more accountability to our representatives and more power to the public through highlighting how frequently reps show up to work and propose new legislation, documenting rep voting habits, and providing more effective ways to contact decision-makers. Tally is a stats-driven, objective source of aggregated government public information. We hope it brings more transparency to the political system outside of the presidency and helps citizens feel more involved in our democratic system.
