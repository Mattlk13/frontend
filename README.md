# Tally

Welcome to Tally, a political awareness app highlighting the roles and responsibilities of our district representatives in the US Senate and Congress. 

Tally aims to bring more accountability to our representatives and more power to the public through revealing how frequently reps show up to work and propose new legislation, documenting rep voting habits, and providing more effective ways to contact decision-makers. 

Tally is a stats-driven, objective source of aggregated government public information. We hope it brings more transparency to the political system outside of the presidency and helps citizens feel more involved in our democratic system.

### Tech Stack
Tally is built with React, GraphQL and Relay with a Python API and a SQL database for both users and government data.

Check out the Python code [here](https://github.com/alexhubbard89/reps_app).
