# Tally

Tally is a political awareness app highlighting the roles and responsibilities of our district representatives in the US Senate and Congress. 

Tally aims to bring more accountability to our representatives and more power to the public through revealing how frequently reps show up to work and propose new legislation, documenting rep voting habits, and providing more effective ways to contact decision makers. 

Tally is a stats-driven, objective source of aggregated public information. We hope it brings more transparency to the political system and helps citizens feel more involved in today's chaotic political climate.

### Tech Stack
Tally is built with React, GraphQL and Relay with a Python API and a SQL database for both users and government data.
