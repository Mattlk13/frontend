### About
2018 midterm elections are around the corner. Do your Senators & Congresspeople deserve your vote?

We've gathered and scored your reps' attendance, sponsored legislation, voting record, and ideology trends — dating all the way back to 1989. Tally is journalism-free, so you can spend less time sifting through headlines and focus on metrics that matter.
